                    Coding is telling a computer what to do, in a way that, with a bit of translation, it can
                    understand.

                    You give computers instructions in what is known as 'code', in a similar way to how you might have a
                    recipe for how to cook something. You tell the computer about elements it needs to work with (like
                    the ingredients), you give it instructions, and there might be some conditions it needs to choose
                    between (like choosing whether an oven is electric or gas and then following the corresponding
                    temperature).

                    These instructions you give the computer need to be broken down into every single task, without
                    ambiguity. It can take practice to think as a computer would so you can work out what instructions
                    would need to be written.

                <p class="heading">&nbspUseful concepts in coding</p>
                <p class="p1">Lots of the key concepts in coding are similar across different coding languages. They often follow similar rules (though there are exceptions) and the terminology can be the same. Here's some useful definitions:<br><br>

                    Variables are values stored in the computer by the code, which can change and can be used by referencing the variable's name.
                    Each variable will have a data type, which tells the computer what kind of information is stored in that variable and determines what can be done with that variable. Common ones include numbers, strings (text), and a list of values (also called an array).<br><br>
                    Operators do things with variables, such as calculations or logic. For example, mathematical operators like +-*/ can be used to do calculations, and logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT can be used to combine statements using logic (you might've done this before when searching online).<br><br>
                    Comments are text in the code that is not read by the computer, but are designed to be read by humans. They make it easier for you and others to understand what your code is doing, or to stop a line of code from running when you're testing.
                    Loops are a way of repeating a section of code for different values, without having to write the code out many times.
                    Conditions allow you to add decisions to code, asking IF something is true or false to decide if some code should run.
                    And functions allow you to define a section of code with a name so you can make it run in different places in your code, again without writing it out many times.</p>
